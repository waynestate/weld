# Which command when[#](https://weld.apps.wayne.edu/docs/reference/which-command.html#which-command-when)

This page is the canonical copy of the "which command when" table. Every README of a stack project that ships one of these commands carries the same table, word for word; change it here first, then copy it into those READMEs (WELD, Squire, PROCTOR, Sourdough, Booster and Rollcall).

Several stack commands sound alike (`weld:doctor`, `squire doctor`, `proctor check`) and do different jobs. Find your question in the second column and run the command beside it. The doctors look at setup, the proctor grades against policy, and the gate decides deploys: same waiting room, different appointments.

| Command | What it checks | When to run it | Where it runs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `composer ci` | **Will my pipeline pass?** The repo's own CI contract, the same command the pipeline runs: validation, the tests, Pint, PHPStan, `composer audit` and whatever checks the repo adds. | Before every push. | App repo, CI |
| `bin/weld.sh doctor` or `.\bin\weld.ps1 doctor` (both run `php artisan weld:doctor`) | **Does my WELD app hold together?** The app key, writable `storage` and `bootstrap/cache`, the database connection and pending migrations. One PASS, WARN or FAIL line each; exit 1 on a FAIL. Standards are PROCTOR's. | After `up`, when the app will not start, and after every deploy off Citadel. | App repo (in the app container), deploy host (in the app container) |
| `vendor/bin/squire doctor` | **Is my Citadel release setup right?** `build.sh`, the release scripts, the health check, script hygiene, line endings, secrets kept out of git and the local parity setup, against Squire's rules. Exit 1 on a failed rule. The lock file, audit and MySQL 5.6 checks are handed to PROCTOR. | After `squire init` or `squire update`, and before the first deploy. | App repo, CI |
| `vendor/bin/squire init --check` | **Have the files Squire wrote drifted from its templates?** Missing, outdated or edited copies. Writes nothing; exit 1 on drift. | After you upgrade Squire (then run `squire update`), and in CI. | App repo, CI |
| `vendor/bin/squire doctor oracle`, or `php artisan oracle:check` in WELD and Sourdough's Laravel apps | **Can my app reach Oracle?** The `ORACLE_*` settings, the host, the port, the `oci8` driver and the login, in plain language, printing setting names and never values. Silent when the app has no Oracle settings. | After you fill in the `ORACLE_*` settings, or when a connection fails. Squire's `release.sh` runs the same check on every release, as a report. | App repo, deploy host |
| `vendor/bin/proctor check` (`composer proctor` in WELD and Sourdough's apps) | **Does my app meet CREED's policy?** The PHP floor, Laravel, Node and MySQL end of life, the committed lock, `composer audit`, open-ended constraints, portability, MySQL 5.6 safety, overrides and the rest of its checks. Exit 1 on a FAIL. | Before you merge; the pipeline runs it too. | App repo, CI |
| `vendor/bin/proctor gate` | **May this commit deploy?** The deploy-time subset of `proctor check`, ratcheted against the last release's verdict, so a deploy that makes nothing worse goes. Exit 1 is a no-go. | At deploy time. Squire's `release.sh` calls it for you. | Deploy host |
| `sourdough manifest --check` | **Which managed files did I change since Sourdough baked my app?** Managed files that changed or are missing against `.sourdough/manifest.json`; seeded files are yours and never reported. Exit 1 on a change. | Before `sourdough feed`. | App repo, CI |
| `sourdough feed --dry-run` | **Is my app behind its Sourdough template?** The plan a feed would apply, with nothing written. Exit 1 when feeding would change files. | After you install a new Sourdough, and in CI to catch an app falling behind. | App repo, CI |
| `booster plan` | **What does my upgrade take?** The ordered PHP, Laravel and front-end hops, the dependencies that block them, and advisory PHPCompatibility and PHPStan scans. Changes nothing. | Before an upgrade, and when PROCTOR says your PHP or Laravel is past support. | App repo |
| `booster replay check` | **Does my app still answer the same after a change?** Replays the requests in `booster-replay.json` and compares the answers with the ones `booster replay record` saved. Exit 1 on a changed answer. | After an upgrade hop or a hand fix, once you have a recording. | App repo (in Docker) |
| `booster init --check` | **Are Booster's coding-tab playbooks current?** The playbooks in `.agents/skills`. Changes nothing; exit 1 when one is missing or out of date. | After you upgrade Booster, and in CI. | App repo, CI |
| `php bin/regen-check.php --generated <dir>` | **Is WELD still Sourdough's Inertia shape?** WELD, file by file, against a fresh `sourdough new --inertia`; fails only on drift that `.sourdough/regen-baseline.json` does not already accept. | When Sourdough's Inertia shape or WELD changes. | WELD repo, CI |
| `rollcall report` | **Where does the whole fleet stand?** The latest scan's totals against CREED's policy: PHP, Laravel, the auth package, PROCTOR results and the end-of-life burn-down. Always exit 0; it never gates. | After `rollcall scan`, on the scan's schedule. | CI (a scheduled scan job) |
